# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `for` statement
- still a little rough at first, but once i get my barring\s on what i need to do it gets a lot better.
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
- it was kinda confusing at first, but google helped me fill the information gaps I had.

- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
- i think practice is real all i need to get more fluent with them.

- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
- lots, but im using outside resources more and thats really helped.
